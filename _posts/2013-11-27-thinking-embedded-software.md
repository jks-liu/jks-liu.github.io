# Portability is a joke

What is portable software?

1. Run on many architechtures, like x86, avr, arm or 51.
2. Run on platforms, like GNU/Linux, OS/X, windows.
3. Can be compiled by many compilers(or IDEs), like gcc, Visual Studio, Keil, IAR.

There is no portable software, just write your code. Even Linux kernel begins from platform specific code.

# What is the best framwork?

Here, I talk about Embedded software, I does not talk linux. I am talking about micro-controller like cortex-M, msp430, avr, PIC & 51.

# But I like portability

## Portability between Keil C and sdcc.

## Portability between micro-controllers.
